# Neural Network training using Evolutionary Algorithm

To install, first clone the repository, then, using make, do the following:

```shell
    make install # compile my libraries 

    make all # compile the main code

    make run # run the main code
```

It uses my [matrices operation library](https://github.com/joseCarlosAndrade/MatrixOperationLib-C) built for matrices manipulation in C, and also a [mini game](https://github.com/joseCarlosAndrade/dev-jc/tree/main/c/study/game) that I've written in the same language.
